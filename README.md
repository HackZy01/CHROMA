# Chroma, a clean B&W theme for Nintendo Switch

This repository contains the theme's source code as well as all the assets that are extractable using Switch Theme Injector.

Please note that Chroma is a very intricate theme as it massively rely on animations and convenient re-use of pre-existing UI elements (which is often the case with my NXTheme releases). You will most likely have a very hard time to tweak this theme without considerably changing its different layouts. Also, most colors are dynamically handled (through animations) so the process of editing them will not be as straightforward as editing hex values within the JSON files.
