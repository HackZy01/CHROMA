# CHROMA, sleek themes for Nintendo Switch

CHROMA is an NXTheme project that aims to (hopefully) bring sleek designs to your Switch interface, providing a collection of themes that share similar UI design criteria. The intent here was to turn one year's worth of accumulated knowledge in Switch theming into full-fledged and coherent theme packs. While I don't consider the end result anywhere near perfect, great attention has still been given to color consistency and details.

As of now, it comes in **8 layout variants for the home screen** (more specifically the games row), and it's pre-bundled with a few color schemes.

Contributors are always welcome, so feel free to fork this repository if you want to implement additional color schemes. Excluding bug reports, I won't be taking any requests.

**Important: set your console to dark mode before using CHROMA** (System Settings > Themes > Basic Black)

## Features

**Layout variants (base layouts)**

- **Regular squared:** big squared icons. The focus animation when a game is highlighted is similar to what can be seen in SteamOS' Big Picture Mode.
- **Regular rounded:** same as right above but icons are rounded.

**Color schemes**

- **B&W** (base color scheme)

## Theme editing

This repository contains the themes' source code as well as their assets. Before anything else, [check out the documentation](https://layoutdocs.themezer.net/) to learn more about editing layouts. Additionally, a wiki that explicits the specifics of those themes *might* be published at some point.

Now, please note that CHROMA involves very intricate layouts as they massively rely on animations and convenient re-use of pre-existing UI elements (which is often the case with my NXTheme releases). You will most likely have a hard time to tweak those themes without breaking something. Also, most colors are dynamically handled (through animations) so making color changes isn't as straightforward as editing hex values within the JSON files. In fact, you will absolutely need Layout Editor for most of the UI.

**Credits would be greatly appreciated if you're planning to publicly share your edited theme.**
